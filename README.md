## The Power of Plots - Pymaceuticals

To complete this I am tasked with:

1. Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
2. Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
3. Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
4. Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
5. Including 3 observations about the results of the study. I must use the visualizations I generated from the study data as the basis for my observations.
